### Background

AI is definitely a hit since OpenAI released ChatGPT at the end of November 2022. 
Basically every fintech compony claimed to integrate AI in their operational logic and VCs are extremely FOMO on spilling money on unicorns.
Even some traditional compony which have been listed on US stock market pumped their stock price by including AI in service.

As a degen in DeFi and a newbie in AI, I do want to learn this promissing tech by combining this two areas.
Obviously, I am not qualified to create an alogorism and train my own model to compete with OpenAI. 
Insteadly, I can build some interesting bot based on universal one -- ChatGPT.

### Possible usage and shortage of current ChatGPT demo

The use case is as important as the technology itself. 
I believe most ppl don't understand what digital 3d and IMAX can do before *Avatar I* relased.
AI is the same situation. ChatGPT is a huge usage that excited ppl worldwide, but I expect much more than that.
